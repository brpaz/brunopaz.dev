There are multiple ways to run this project on local environment:

- Directly on host machine (requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) >=20 and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/))
- Using [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
- Using [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev/)

### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:brpaz/brunopaz.dev.git
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Starting the dev server

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

By default, this will start the application at `http://localhost:4321`.

> [!TIP]
> You can override the default port the server listens to by specifiying `PORT` envrionment variable.

### Running Tests

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is used for E2E tests.

You can run the provided test suite using `pnpm run test:e2e` command.

For performance tests, [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) is used. Run `pnpm run test:lh` to execute the tests.

## Build for production

```sh
pnpm build
```

> [!TIP]
> This will generate a fully static website into `dist` folder, which can then be deployed on any static sites hosting like Netlify or Vercel.
