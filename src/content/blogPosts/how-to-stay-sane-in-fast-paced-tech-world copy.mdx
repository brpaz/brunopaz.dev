In today's fast-paced tech world, it can be overwhelming to keep up with the constant changes and innovations. In this article, I will share some of my learnings that have helped me to keep my sanity, while still being able to be continuously learning and keeping up with the industry.

## Pickup your battles wisely

In the tech industry, there are always new frameworks, languages, and tools emerging. It's easy to feel pressured to learn everything and to jump to the latest trend.

The first step is to be in peace with yourself that you can't known everything. This can be a hard pill to swallow, specially if you are really passionate about tech, but it's crucial for your mental well-being. Accept that you will never be able to keep up with everything, and that's okay.

Pick your battles wisely. Resist the temptation of [Hype Driven Development](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22) and the new shiny thing and focus on what is relevant to your work and interests.

A good example of this are the Blockhain and AI technologies. And let´s not get started about the latest shiny new JS framework of the day! Those technologies are still trying to find their market fit and evolving at a very fast pace. Taking the example of AI, in a very short time we wnt from RAG being the big thing, to Agents, and more recently, it´s all about MCP servers. Who knows what will be next?

It would be really easy to get caught up in the rabbit hole of trying to jump straight into the all of those technologies and learn every single detail about them. However, due to the crazy pace of all these changes, it is very likely that by the time you finish learning one of them, it will already be outdated or replaced by something else. This can lead to frustruation and burnout, as you will feel like you are always behind and never able to catch up.

Instead, let them mature before you invest significant time and energy into them. Of course, it´s useful to know about them, and the problems they trying to solve, and read a few blogs to understand the very basic concepts and state of the tech doesnt hurt, but be extra careful not to get into the previously mentioned rabbit hole.

## Use "boring" technologies

It´s easy to get caught up with the hype of the latest and greatest technologies. However, choosing a "boring" technology is often a better choice for your projects.

There is a difference between being "boring" and being outdated. Boring technologies are often the ones that have been tested and refined over time, making them more reliable and easier to work with. They may not be the flashiest or most exciting, but they get the job done. Think about technologies like Python, Java, Go, or even PHP. They may not be the latest trends, but they are widely used and have a large community of developers.

Using established technologies will save you time and effort in the long run. They often have a larger community, better documentation, and more resources available.

This doens´t mean you should not learn new things, but rather that you should be selective about what you invest your time in.

Think about your goals. Are you building something just for fun or learning? That´s fine, go ahead and experiment with the latest and greatest. But if you are building something for production, or for a client, consider using a more established technology that will be easier to maintain and support in the long run.

Think about trade-offs of your choices. Does the new technology you are considering bring any real value to your project? Or is it just a shiny new toy that will require more time and effort to learn and implement? What are the chances that it will be around in a few years? Is it stable engouh or could face an Angular 1 to Angular 2 situation and be completely rewritten in a few months, which would require you to rewrite your codebase from scratch?

Choosing "boring" technologies doesn't mean you are not innovative or not keeping up with the latest trends. It means you are being smart about your choices and focusing on what really matters for your projects.

## Set your goals and priorities clearly

Why do you want to learn something new? Is it because you are genuinely interested in it? Is it because you think it will land you a better job? Are you feeling FOMO because everyone else is talking about it and saying how great it is?

Defining your goals and priorities is essential to stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by the constant influx of new information.

Start by asking yourself what you want to achieve in the short and long term. Do you want to become an expert in a specific technology? Do you want to learn a new programming language? Do you want to improve your soft skills?

Once you have a clear understanding of your goals, you can prioritize your learning accordingly. Focus on the areas that will help you achieve your goals and set realistic timelines for yourself.

Be pragmatic! Think about with the resources you have (time, will) and your goals, what is the most important thing you can learn right now that will have the biggest impact for achieving your goals? Focus on that and don´t get distracted by the noise around.

## Limit your information intake

We live in the age of information overload. It's easy to get lost in the sea of articles, videos, podcasts, and social media posts. While staying informed is important, consuming too much information can have adverse effects on your mental health and productivity.

Set limits on the amount of information you consume daily. Choose a few trusted sources and stick to them. Use RSS feeds and newsletters to curate your content. Those allows you to read new content on your own pace and avoid the doomscrolling effect of social media.

## Set a dedicated time for learning

Continuous learning is something that you cannot really avoid in the tech industry, However, this doens´t need to be an overwhelming task. Make it a regular activity in your routine and make sure it´s manageable.

Reading a blog post, listening to a podcast episode. That´s learning! You don´t need to be building a big project every time. Just a few minutes a day can make a big difference over time. The key is to do it consistently.

Subscribe to a newsletter on your favorite topics and skim through the articles that caught your attention in a defined schedule, like every morning or once a week. This will help you stay informed without the need to be constantly connected.

## Take breaks and disconnect

Taking breaks and "touching grass" is essential to maintain your mental well-being. The tech industry can be demanding, and it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of it all, specially if tech is more than just a job, but also a big passion and part of who you are, like it is for me.

Go for a walk, take a few days where you don't touch your computer and don´t think about tech. This can help you recharge and come back with a fresh perspective.

Focus on your own journey, and don´t compare yourself to others. In the age of social media, it´s easy to feel you are not doing enough or that you are falling behind, but remember that everyone has their own pace and path. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.
