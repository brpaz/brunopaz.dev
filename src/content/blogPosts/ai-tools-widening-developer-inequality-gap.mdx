excerpt: AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT are becoming essential for developers, but their high costs threaten to widen the gap between those who can afford them and those who can't. How will this impact the accessibility of software development?

One of the greatest things about programming, is how in the internet age, you can learn to code from anywhere in the world for free, thanks to the myriad of resources available online, such as Blogs, Forums, sites like Stack Overflow or FreeCodeCamp, Youtube tutorials, EBooks, Open Source projects and many more. You "just" need a computer and an internet connection and you can become a programmer.

Yes, Developers with a better socioeconomic status can benefit from more formal education and training opportunities, as well as accesses to more expensive courses, certifications or simply more powerful computers, so it´s not a completely fair playing field. But that´s how life is. Still, I think the differences are not as significant as they can become, in the age of AI.

AI today is expensive. Subscriptions to state of art models like Claude or Chat GPT will cost at least $20 per month. And those can use your token quota quickly, so if your are serious about using AI in your work, you might need to subscribe to their bigger plans, which in case of Claude, will cost you at least $100 per month. And if we go in a direction of a multi model world, where different models might be better suited for different tasks, the subscription count will rise significantly, if you need access to Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT, for example. Self hosting your own AI models is not a trivial task and requires a lot of compute resources and GPU power, which are also very expensive nowadays.

You might say, that AI is just a tool, and people can just still code the "old way", so it´s not really blocking anyone from learning to code and build projects. That´s true, but if the world really evolves towards a world, where AI does the majority of the coding work, the differences between those that have access to the best AI tools and those who don´t, will increase the gap significantly.

It´s not clear yet, if this world will become a reality or if it´s simpply an utopia originated from the hype we are experiencing.
Personally, I think AI is here to stay and will become more and more integrated into our lives, but I also don´t believe in the extreme vision that AI will simply replace human programmers entirely. I see AI more as an assistant role, while humans will still be the ones who design, architect and drive the projects.

There is another potential side effect of AI that must not be underestimated, that can also lead to an increase in inequality. With the aggressive scrapping and the lack of attribution of AI-generated content, many may start to gate their content to protect it from being used without permission. This will lead to more closed ecosystems, and the information available for free online will decrease.

Since people will get used to get all their information from AI, there will be less incentives to write and discuss on public forums. This is already impacting for example platforms like Stack Overflow, which have seen a steady decline in the number of questions and answers posted. (there are more reasons than AI for this, but still, it has contributed).

## Conclusion

It´s not clear yet, how far AI can go and how it will impact the world. Everything is changing so fast. But one thing is certain, that AI is here to stay.

Maybe the costs will decrease over time, as the technology evolves with better computer chips and more efficient algorithms. We have seen that happen through the history of computing. Only time will tell.

Independently of what will happen, it´s important to keep the values of diversity, inclusion and equity in mind. Building software should not be a priviledge for a few, but a right for everyone.
