Constant learning is an important part of the life of a Software Engineer. But organizing and Digesting all that knowledge and information from multiple sources like Blog posts, newsletters, social networks, documentation sites can be a daunting task.

In this post, I will talk about the tools I use to help me with that.

## Raindrop

<Picture src={raindropImg} alt="Raindrop Image"/>

[Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) describes itself as "All-in-one bookmark manager". It can work as a replacement for the browser bookmarks but I use both, for different purposes. Browser bookmarks for more permament storage like links to sites and applications I use most, Raindrop mostly as an inbox of new content that I want to process.

When I found some interesting resource like a blog post that I want to read and process, I save it in Raindrop using it´s web clipper. Raindrop has a very clean UI and allows you to tag and organize your articles into collections, making easier to find all the links associated with a specific topic.

It´s a very recent tool in my workflow but I am very happy so far. I used [Pocket](getpocket.com/) for this before discovering Raindrop and it´s also a great tool, but it´s more focused on reading features like it´s "Reading Mode", which I didn´t really need. Organization features are more important to me and while Pocket also allows to tag articles for example, I feel Raindrop is more tailored to that.

I have a couple of collections/folders in my Raintrop like:

* Unsorted - This is a default collection in Raindrop, where links are saved by default. I use it as my Inbox, before moving or tagging links to a more appropriate collection. If I just want to save something and process later, this collection is a place to go.
* Dev Articles - Where I save links to articles related to Software Development that I found intersting or want to process later.
* Code - Links for code related stuff like Libraries, GitHub Projects, etc.
* Courses - Links to online courses that I might want to enroll.
* Books - Links to Books that I want to read.
* Product Hunt - Links to new interesting SaaS applications.
* Shopping - Links to products that I am interested to buy.

You can also add different icons for each collection makes it easier to identify.

I found this structure is working pretty well for me.

## Notion / Obsidian

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as my central knowledge base and note taking platform. Every piece of information that I want to save, from a simple list of links related with some topic to book notes and annotations is stored in there. I also use it for project planning and specification.

It´s a very powerfull software that is widely popular right now and it´s incredibly flexible.

Here´s an example what the structure of my "Dev" workspace in Notion looks like:

Notion is not the fastest application. Some parts, like the search, is sometimes slow, which is not good. They are working on Performance, Offline and also on an API. let´s see how it improves.

I recently discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which works on top of a local folder with plain text Markdown files. It´s still in early stages of development, but It seems to be gaining momentum and have a strong community. It´s a lot faster than notion, and it has a plugin system which could be huge, for more personalized workflows. It also has a graph view where you can see how your notes are connected.

I will keep following it´s development, and might switch from Notion. Not decided yet. Both are great choices, for sure.

## Memex

[Memex](https://getmemex.com/) it´s also a bookmarking tool that can be somewhat used like Raindrop, but it has a very distinct feature, which is highlighting and annotating web pages.

It´s great when learning a new topic or to save specific bits of information from an article or web page. I can create a collection like an outline for a specific topic and then highlight and annotate interesting parts from multiple sources about that topic and have then together, so I can process them later.

I used [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/) for this purpose before, but Memex is a lot more modern and in active development. It is also Open Source, which is always nice.

## Cacher

I use [Cacher](https://www.cacher.io/) to store and organize my code snippets. It syncs with GitHub Gist and have integrations with all the popular Code editors like VS Code or Jetbrains IDEs.

It also have a browser extension that allows to easily save snippets from the web and a tray application for quick access to your snippets.

I still use my code editor snippets features for one liners and mostly used snippets as the autocomplete it´s still faster, but Cacher works great as a library for interesting pieces of code that I stumbled upon.

## Conclusion

This is the current list of tools that I use to manage my knowledge. I am quite happy with them and my workflow but in tech everything changes pretty rapidly, so this list could look very different in a year.

Besides Cacher, which I have been using for a while, all of these tools, I started using only last year. I have tried many others in the past from [Evernote](https://evernote.com) in the early days to [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/), [Notable](https://notable.app/), [Pocket](getpocket.com/) .... And when I thought Notion was perfect, I discovered Obsidian. It´s a never ending quest to the perfect workflow! ;)

I get inspired by articles like this, presenting tools I don´t know about. Hope this can also help someone to discover something new.
