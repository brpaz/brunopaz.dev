**Jumia Flights** is a flight booking website, focused on the African market, and inspired by [Skyscanner](https://skycanner.com).

I have worked on this project from the ground up, including:

- Define the general application architecture following a Microservices architecture.
- Implement core features such as Search, Booking, and Payments, using Java (Play Framework) and PHP (Phalcon Framework).
- Implementation of the Search Rules engine, using Golang.
- Integration with popular third-party Flights providers like [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com) and [Kiwi](https://www.kiwi.com/en/).
- Multi-provider search using Web Sockets.
