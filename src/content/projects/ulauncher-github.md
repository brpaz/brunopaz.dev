## What is Ulauncher?

Ulauncher is an open-source application launcher for Linux, similar to macOS Spotlight or Alfred. It's highly customizable and supports extensions for enhanced functionality.

## Extension Features

- **Quick Repository Access**: Search and open your GitHub repositories instantly
- **Gist Management**: Browse and access your GitHub gists
- **Fast Navigation**: Jump to GitHub pages without opening a browser first
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Fully keyboard-accessible workflow for maximum productivity
- **GitHub Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub API for real-time data

## Why I Built This

As a developer who frequently switches between projects and references gists, I wanted faster access to my GitHub resources without context-switching to a browser. This extension eliminates that friction.

## Use Cases

- Quickly open a repository in your default browser
- Search through your repositories by name
- Access frequently used gists
- Navigate GitHub resources while staying focused on your terminal or IDE

## Technical Details

- Built with Python for seamless Ulauncher integration
- Uses GitHub REST API for data fetching
- Implements caching for improved performance
- Configurable through Ulauncher's extension settings
- Handles authentication via GitHub personal access tokens

Perfect for Linux developers who want to integrate GitHub into their daily workflow without leaving their keyboard.
