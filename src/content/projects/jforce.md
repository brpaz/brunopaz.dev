Jumia JForce is a sales consultant program launched by **Jumia**, an e-commerce platform operating primarily in Africa. The JForce initiative is designed to empower independent sales agents, known as "JForce Agents," who earn commissions by helping customers place orders on Jumia`s platform.

These agents typically assist people who may not be familiar with online shopping or those without internet access, helping them navigate the e-commerce site and place orders.

On this project, my main responsabilities were:

- **Service and API Development:** Worked in a cross functional team to develop the essential services and APIs for JForce, a platform to manage Jumia Agents, including agent registration, sales management, commission calculation, levels, and bonuses, using Golang and PHP/Symfony within a microservices architecture.

- **Order Processing System:** Implemented an order processing system, leveraging Golang concurrency features like Channels and Go Routines to efficiently import daily orders from Jumia various websites and calculate commissions and bonuses for each agent, based on the defined business rules.
