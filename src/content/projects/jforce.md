**JForce** is a web application created to help manage the thousands of agents that Jumia has in the field
across all of Africa.

The agents could register on the platform and have quick access to their sales, commissions earned, bonuses, and more.

On this project, I worked with my team to develop all the core features of the application from scratch, including:

- Development of all necessary services and APIs , for agents registration, sales management, commission calculation,
levels and bonuses, following a Microservices oriented architecture.
- Orders Processing System that used Golang concurrency features to daily import all the orders from all the Jumia websites.
- Commissions calculation engine
