Jumia Travel is a Hotel booking application, focused on the African market.

It includes over 25,000 hotel listings across 40 African countries and 200,000 hotels across the globe.

Some of the areas I worked on, include:

- Rates availability and search engine
- Channel Management and Partners Integration
- Extranet web/mobile application for Hotel Owners
- API architecture and development
