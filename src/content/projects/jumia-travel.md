Jumia Travel is an online travel agency that focused on making it easier for users to find and book accommodations across Africa.

Part of the larger Jumia Group, Jumia Travel offers a platform where travelers can search for hotels, compare prices, and make reservations online.

The service cater primarily to the African market, providing access to a wide range of accommodation options, from budget hotels to luxury resorts, helping to promote domestic and international tourism within the continent.

On Jumia Travel, I worked on the following areas:

- **Worked in multiple Scrum teams** (Search, API, Extranet) to develop features across the different areas of Jumia Travel, an Hotel bookings platform focused on the African Market.

- **Search Engine Development**: Worked on the development of the hotel search engine using ElasticSearch to index hotel data and applied different weights for fields like location, price or reviews to rank the results, in order to provide more relevant results for the user.

- **Booking & Payment Processes:** Designed and implemented a state machine for the booking and payment workflows, in order to ensure the data consistency and business rules.

- **Extranet for Hotel Owners:** Developed the backend and APIs that powered the Jumia Travel Extranet, a web and mobile platform that helped Hotel Owners to manage their Jumia Travel properties, including room availability, pricing, and booking approvals.

- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrated with third-party hotel catalog providers such as Expedia and Channel Management systems like Siteminder, using both SOAP and REST APIs to expand the Jumia Travel Catalog and facilitate the management of the properties listed on Jumia Travel, by the Hotel owners.
