**JumiaPay** is an online payment platform, deeply integrated with the rest of the Jumia ecosystem,
the leading E-Commerce platform of Africa.

As an Engineering Manager, I was responsible for the "Business Team", which was dedicated to building tools
for the Merchants that use JumiaPay as the payment provider for their shops.

Some of the work included:

- Define the global architecture and technical vision of all the services owned by the team,
following a Microservices-oriented architecture.

- Work closely with the Product Owner to help shape the product roadmap,
  mostly by analyzing the possible technical challenges of a feature and proposing solutions
  and also by providing some high-level estimations of the effort required to build each feature.

- Support and mentor other team members, including doing presentations to share knowledge, Code reviews,
  pair programming sessions, 1 on 1 feedback sessions, and more.

- Responsible for the evaluation process for all the technical team members (Developers and QAs)
  and defining team and individual KPIs.

- Doing interviews both for Porto and Egypt offices, with the goal to build a 2nd team.
