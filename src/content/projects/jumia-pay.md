JumiaPay is Jumias digital payment platform that simplifies online transactions across Africa. It allows users to make secure payments for goods, services, and utilities, both on Jumias marketplace and beyond. The platform aims to enhance financial inclusion by providing a convenient and reliable payment solution in regions with limited banking services.

On JumiaPay, I have worked first as a Senior Software Engineer and then as Engineering manager, with the following responsabilities:

- **Team Leadership:** Led the "Business Team," consisting of five engineers and a QA, responsible for developing a platform for JumiaPay Merchants to manage their business, including sales, refunds, settlements, and more.
- **Architecture and Technical Vision:** Defined the overall architecture and technical direction for all services owned by the team, following a microservices oriented approach.
- **Product Roadmap Collaboration:** Collaborated closely with the Product Owner to shape the product roadmap by analyzing technical challenges, proposing solutions, and providing high-level effort estimations for new features.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Worked with other teams to align on technical solutions, share best practices, and ensure the overall quality of the JumiaPay platform.
- **Team Mentorship and Development:** Supported and mentored team members through knowledge-sharing presentations, code reviews, pair programming sessions, one-on-one feedback, and career development discussions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Managed the evaluation process for all technical team members, setting and tracking team and individual KPIs.
- **Hiring and Recruitment:** Led the hiring process for team expansion in both Porto and Egypt locations.
- **Architecture and Tech Stack Planning:** Collaborated with the Engineering Manager to define the architecture and tech stack for the new "Jumia Pay Business" platform.
- **Platform Development:** Worked in the development of the backend of various modules of JumiaPay Business, including the Merchant account creation, User Management, Sales, Refunds, Settlements, Withdrawals and Wallet Top-Ups.
- **API Integration:** Integrated JumiaPay Business  with other JumiaPay services like Payment and Wallets services, using RESTful APIs, Webhooks and Events, in order to provide the merchant with a full view of their business.
- **Top-Ups Processing System:** Developed a system to process the merchant wallet top-ups, using Golang to read a CSV file with a list of wallets and amounts and trigger the top-up process asyncronously using Apache Kafka.
- **API Refactoring and Documentation:** Refactored the existing public Merchant API in Java for improved performance and consistency, and built a documentation portal using Markdown and Redoc.
- **Testing and Automation:** Pushed for the implementation of automated acceptance testing across the JumiaPay platform using Cucumber and Gherkin, to improve the release quality and reducing the QA teams reliance on manual testing.
