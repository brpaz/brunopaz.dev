I have always been a bit obssessed (in a good way) in the looking for tools to improve my developement workflows and productivity. Time is a precious and scarse resource, so I don´t want to waste any of it doing manual and boring tasks that could be automated or to search for information that I have already seen before. I prefer to focus my time in building real things and solving problems. That´s why optimizing your workflow and make use of the best tools is really important.

Finding the "best" tools and workflows is a continuous process and I have experimented with many different solutions, some of them I tought were top notch, were later replaced by new and better ones and the cycle will continue for sure. But I am quite happy with what I have been using now. That´s why I decided to write this article. To share my experience with you.

Tooling and workflows are a very personal thing. What works for me, might not work for you, and you should aim to find your balance. Hope this article can help inspire you to find what works best for you.

Let´s start.

## Raindrop

[Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) is an Web Application and Browser extension that works All-in-one bookmark manager. I use Raindrop to save any interesting piece of information that I found online and want to refer to it later. Articles or books to read, Products to try, Code Libraries to experiment, etc.

Raindrop is my first line to process information from the web. I use it mostly as a "Read Later" service like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/), but with a lot more features, in terms of organization your content. You can use folders/collections with nested levels, tags and more.

By default I will save all the bookmarks in the "Unsorted" collection, and then when I procecss each item, I can archive into a specific collection as well as add relevant tags.

I still use browser bookmarks for purely bookmark frequently used websites that doens´t change offten.

## Obsidian

I have tried tons of Note taking tools before, from commercial ones like Evernote to Open Source ones like Joplin or Boostnote. But none of them really stood up to me. Until I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Obsidian is a lot more that a note taking app, but it works as a second brain, that you can use to organize all your personal knowledge. Obsidian works completely offline and uses plain text Markdown files to store it´s contents. I manaully sync my notes to a GitHub repository to keep them safe and versioned and then use [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) to access the notes from my Phone.

Obsidian also have a very big list of plugins that you can use extend it´s functionality. Some great examples are [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) that allows you to store and edit [Excalidraw](excalidraw.com) files, in your notes.

I use Obsidian for almost everything from storing notes about programming languages, code snippets, book highlights,online courses notes and much more.

## TickTick / Gnome Todo

For my todo list management and reminders, I found [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/) to be one of the best apps and believe me, I tried a lot of them! I really like how the reminders feature work and that you can easily snooze your tasks. You can also group your tasks into different lists and use tags to better organize them.

For work related daily tasks, I use [Gnome Todo](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Todo) on my work laptop.

## Memex

## Ulauncher

I use [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) as an application launcher and also as a way to quicly access a few commands and websites. Context switching can kill a productive moment, and having an application that you can trigger with a keyboard shortcut and floats on top of your current windows is great.
