        Born in the beautiful and "unbeatable" city of Porto, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, I
        have been working as a Web Engineer since 2011, working in industries
        like B2B Apps for small businesses, E-Commerce, Travel and Payments.

        My main expertise is terms of programming languages are <a

        Despite my knowledge and preferences, I believe in always choose the

        outside of my confort zone.

        I am a fast learner and I donÂ´t believe in silver bullets or in "Hype
        Driven Development". Context is very important and I try to balance
        pragmatism, with the normal desire and curiosity to experiment with some
        new tech. There are many cases where using a stable and "boring"
        technology is the better choice.

        were I graduated in 2010.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This was the year I also start working at my first company, <b>ueb</b>,
        a small startup, developing Web solutions for small busineses (ex:
        <a href="https://www.uebbill.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >uebbill</a
        >) and a customer satisfaction platform for the Automobile area, as well
        as websites for specific clients, like

          >SOS Consultoria</a

        or

        >.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        As we were very few developers and with lots of challenging projects, I
        ended up having to do a bit of everything from Frontend, Backend to
        Server management, so it was an incredible learning experience.
      </p>
      <hr class="flex w-1/2 mt-12 mb-12 border-blue-300 mx-auto" />
      <p>
        In 2014, it was time for a new challenge and I joined
        <b
          ><a href="https://group.jumia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Jumia</a
          >
          Porto Tech Center.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Jumia is one of the biggest E-Commerce solutions in Africa with
        operations in more than 10 countries. I start at the Jumia Travel
        (formelly known as Jovago) project, with the goal to make it the biggest
        Hotel Booking platform in Africa.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This was a completely different reality, from what I was used to. From
        less than 5 developers to a team around 30. Also the scale was much
        bigger as the application was serving thousands of users. I learned a
        ton!
      </p>
      <hr class="flex w-1/2 mt-12 mb-12 border-blue-300 mx-auto" />
      <p class="mb-4">
        Later, in 2017, I started working on a new Jumia project, Jumia Flights,
        an "extension" of Jumia Travel to the Flights Business. While my
        teammates were all prevously in Travel, it was a completely new context,
        as we had to build and architech an entire new application from scratch,
        in a very very complex Flights business.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In less than an year, we managed to release the first version. Using
        some newer technologies like VueJS in frontend and Go in backend,
        together with a mature Java core and a Microservices oriented
        architecture, we managed to build a really cool and scalable product.
        The project was sold to a partner, some months later.
      </p>
      <hr class="flex w-1/2 mt-12 mb-12 border-blue-300 mx-auto" />
      <p class="mb-4">
        After Flights, a new short term project, J-Force, an internal Jumia
        application to manage their agents on the field, before starting on
        <a href="https://pay.jumia.com.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >JumiaPay</a

        application, where the Merchants can see the Purchases in their shops, manage
        refunds, withdraw money to their Bank accounts etc.
      </p>

      <hr class="flex w-1/2 mt-12 mb-12 border-blue-300 mx-auto" />
      <p class="mb-4">
        After 8 years working in the same company, I felt the need for a new
        challenge. I always believed in tech as a way to improve peoples lives
        and so <b
